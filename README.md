# LexiParse_Lexical-Syntax_Analyzer
LexiParse is a lexical and syntactic analyzer developed in Java. It scans source code to identify tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.) and checks syntax validity based on a defined grammar. It can be used as an educational tool to understand compiler mechanisms or as a foundation for static analysis tools.
