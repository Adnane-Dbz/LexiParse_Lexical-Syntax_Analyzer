# LexiParse - Lexical and Syntax Analyzer

## Description
LexiParse is a lexical and syntax analyzer developed in Java. Its purpose is to analyze source code to identify different tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.) and verify syntactic validity according to a defined grammar. It can be used as an educational tool to understand compiler functionality or as a foundation for static analysis tools.

## Features
- Lexical analysis: token detection.
- Syntax analysis: validation of code structure.
- Handling of lexical and syntax errors.
- Extensible for different programming languages.
